## Definition
hash function transfer any value to certain conditioned value such as length.
If the input value is same, the output value should be same.

## In use
- encryption
- Hashtable is using hash function to store values quickly.
- Comparing two huge data to verify same file or not quickly.

## Kinds

- cryptographic hash function : hash function that used for encryption
- hash function : hash function that does not used for encryption

## Properties
- efficiency
- uniformity
- collision resistance
- pre-image resistance
- second pre-image resistance
