> **Exclu**sive - **Exclu**ding the last number

In Computer Science, inclusive/exclusive apply to a **number range**

## Example

### inclusive

If a function will compute $$2^i$$ where $$i = 1, 2, ..., n$$. 

$$i$$ can have values from 1 up to *and including* the value `n`. 

We says, n is ***Included*** in ***Inclusive***

```
1 through 10 (inclusive) = [1, 10]
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```

### exclusive

If a function will compute $$2^i$$ where `i = 1, 2, ..., n`

`i` can have values from 1 up to *and including* the value `n-1`. Which means 

`i` can have values from 1 up to *and excluding* the value `n`. 

We says, n is ***excluded*** in ***exclusive***.

```
1 through 10 (exclusive) = [1, 10)
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```
